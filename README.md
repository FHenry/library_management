## Getting Started

### This is a sample/tutorial module

Base on the tutorial available here : https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/tutorial
This code base sample show how Frappe is really a battery included framework.

### Do not trust every things

As it is a tutorial module it is not intended to be use in production, some feature have really strange design (eg. filters valid member into new transaction form), nut it is to explain what is possible with Frapp√©

Happy Frappe learning !
